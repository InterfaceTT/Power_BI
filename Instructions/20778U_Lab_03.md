## Lab: Directly Connecting to Databases

### Exercise 1: Establishing a direct connect to Azure SQL

1. Open a new instance of the Power BI Desktop application
1. Create a connection to a Azure SQL database:
    - Server Name: **interfacett-adlt.database.windows.net**
    - Database Name: **AdventureworksLT**
    - Use Database Credentials: 
        - User Name: **student**
        - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
1. Select and Load the following three tables to include in the PowerBI model :
    - SalesLT.Product
    - SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail
    - SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
1. View the Power BI Model with the three tables: 
    1. Select the **SalesLT Product** table in the model view
        - In the Properties window change the name to **Product**
        - Expand the **Advanced** pane
            - Notice the Storage Mode is set to **DirectQuery**
    1. Select the **SalesLT SalesOrderDetail** table in the model view
        - In the Properties window change the name to **Order Line Item**
        - Expand the **Advanced** pane
            - Notice the Storage Mode is set to **DirectQuery**
    1. Select the **SalesLT SalesOrderHeader** table in the model view
        - In the Properties window change the name to **Order**
        - Expand the **Advanced** pane
            - Notice the Storage Mode is set to **DirectQuery**
    1. View the reports page:
        - In the Fields pane on the right see that the table names reflect the changes you made.
    1. Close the Power BI Desktop application and don't save the file

### Exercise 2: Establishing a Live Connection to SSAS Tabular

1. Open a new instance of the Power BI Desktop application
1. Create a live connection to a Analysis Services:
    - Server Name: **localhost**
    - Database Name: **AdventureworksDW Tab**
1. Notice you are taken immediately to the Report page
1. In the fields pane, open the Internet Sales table to see the fields
    - Right click on the **Internet Sales** table and select **New Measure**
    - In the formula bar above the reports area, type in the following formula:
        - ```Internet Max Sales Amount = MAX('Internet Sales'[Sales Amount])```
    - When live connecting to a tabular database you can add new Measures to the report fields
1. Close the Power BI Desktop application and don't save the file

### Exercise 3: Establishing a Live Connection to SSAS Multidimensional

1. Open a new instance of the Power BI Desktop application
1. Create a live connection to a Analysis Services:
    - Server Name: **localhost\MD**
    - Database Name: **AdventureworksDW Multi**
1. On the Navigator page, select the **Adventure Works** cube and click OK
1. Notice you are taken immediately to the Report page
1. In the Fields pane, open the **Internet Sales** table to see the available measures
    - Unlike with tabular SSAS databases, live connections to MultiDimensional SSAS cubes cannot be enhanced with additional measures
1. Close the Power BI Desktop application and don't save the file
