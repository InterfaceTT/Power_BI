## Lab: Building Data Visualizations

#### Exercise 1: Creating Visualizations

1. Start a new instance of the Power BI Desktop application
1. Open the Power BI PBIX in the following location:
    - File Path: **D:\\Labfiles\\Mod05\\Labfiles\Starter**
    - File name: **Mod05VisualizationStarter.pbix**
1. The Power BI file has a number of pages.  Each pages provides the requirements for a specific visualization and offers a display of the final visualization.  The lower part of the page is a space to create the visualization using the various options in the Fields, Visualization and Filter panes of the Power BI desktop application.  The data model is a simple flat view of the AdventureworksDW database.  The data has been loaded into the PBIX file.  Hierarchies are available for the Product Categores, Location and Order Date.  
1. After building the visualization on each page, optionally look at the finished visualizations in the **Mod05VisualizationSolution.pbix** file in the **D:\\Labfiles\\Mod05\\Labfiles\\Solution** folder.
1. Save the **Mod05VisualizationStart.pbix** file in it's original location.
